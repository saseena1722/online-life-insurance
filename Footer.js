    <p>Insurance is a financial arrangement that provides protection against financial loss or risk. In exchange for regular payments, known as premiums, an insurance policy offers coverage for specific events or circumstances. The purpose of insurance is to mitigate the financial impact of unexpected events, such as accidents, illnesses, property damage, or loss.
      Regular maintenance improves safety

      Faulty headlights, under-inflated tyres, and leaky brake fluid tank these minor problems can cause serious accidents when left unchecked. Even an uncharged battery can result in engine break down while you’re travelling. Imagine being stuck on a desolate road where anything can happen.

The good thing is you can prevent these accidents and breakdowns with regular vehicle maintenance. A well-maintained car is a safe car that you can drive with peace of mind, whether you are off for a long trip or just travelling a short distance.</p>
